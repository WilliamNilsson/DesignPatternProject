# DesignPatternProject
William Nilsson
Project for the course "Objectorienterad Programmering Design"
Systemutveckling Java

The point of the project is to make a short simulation of interacting with a bar. It creates a facade and simulates a user buing drinks. Also it uses a mediator to add two patrons to the bar.
The focus during development was around the the two design patterns, facade and mediator. I achieved creating two separate functionalities with the patterns. However at the moment they cannot interact.
